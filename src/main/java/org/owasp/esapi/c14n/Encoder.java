/**
 * The Encoder interface contains a number of methods for decoding input and encoding output
 * so that it will be safe for a variety of interpreters. To prevent
 * double-encoding, callers should make sure input does not already contain encoded characters
 * by calling canonicalize. Validator implementations should call canonicalize on user input
 * <b>before</b> validating to prevent encoded attacks.
 * <p>
 * All of the methods must use a "whitelist" or "positive" security model.
 * For the encoding methods, this means that all characters should be encoded, except for a specific list of
 * "immune" characters that are known to be safe.
 * <p>
 * The Encoder performs two key functions, encoding and decoding. These functions rely
 * on a set of codecs that can be found in the org.owasp.esapi.codecs package. These include:
 * <ul><li>CSS Escaping</li>
 * <li>HTMLEntity Encoding</li>
 * <li>JavaScript Escaping</li>
 * <li>MySQL Escaping</li>
 * <li>Oracle Escaping</li>
 * <li>Percent Encoding (aka URL Encoding)</li>
 * <li>Unix Escaping</li>
 * <li>VBScript Escaping</li>
 * <li>Windows Encoding</li></ul>

     * as input â€“ even if the user input is encoded.
     *

     *  <script>
